Generic main.css:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/main.css">
</head>

We target elements by ID from jQuery or CSS using a CSS selector with a
hashtag prefix: #buy-now-main-btn. We only expect to find 0 or 1 elements
that match this selector. An element can only have 0 or 1 id, not many.

We target elements by Class from jQuery or CSS using a CSS selector with a
period/dot prefix: .nav-item. We expect to find 0 to n elements that
match this selector, and these elements can be anywhere on the current page.

An element can have 0 to 'n' classes:

Classes imply stylistic or behavioural properties about an element:

For instance, <nav class="secondary disabled"> describes a navigational
element that is secondary and for whatever reason is also disabled at this
time.

Secondary could bring with it certain styles, perhaps the navigations is smalled /
less prominent compared to the primary nav. The disabled class may also
affect its style by making it appear grayed out, and it may also attach
JavaScript behavior such as not allowing the user to expand or click
the links within the nav.

IDs may be used when you have a unique element such as a call to action
that is styled and/or behaves very differently than other elements on a page or
website myb be a good candidate for an ID.

IDs also need to be used when you need to reerence them from the URL using the
anchor hash value. Eg: http://yourdomain.com#comments will jump to the element with
ID comments.
